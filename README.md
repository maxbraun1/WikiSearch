# 2 Week Project
## By: Max Braun & Curtis Clemmons

### Description:
This project creates a Wikipedia page parser app that takes a user input, a wikipedia page name, and gives the users two options.

The First is to see a list of the latest revisions, which will return to the user a list of user names and the time in which they made the revision.

The second option is to see the most active editors, which returns to the user a list of user names and the number of recent edits they have made.

The app also informs the users if they were redirected or if the page couldn't be found.
